abstract sonic artwork create an abstract interactive artwork focussed on sound .In this assignment you will create an abstract interactive artwork focussed on sound.

The goal of this assignment is to create an interactive sound artwork with an abstract visual component. Your work should be engaging, coherent, and use interaction to enhance experience. The sound and visuals should work together coherently and invite a viewer to engage in the work. The interaction in your work engage the viewer in exploration, and set up a feedback loop between viewer and artwork. You should represent a deepening of the experience by allowing viewers to open new scenes or significant transformations of the work through interaction.

This assignment is a significant departure from the first two which were about representational art, and did not include sound. You√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll have to think carefully about the lectures and work you have completed in labs which have helped prepare you for this point. Creating an abstract work can seem difficult, but it can also be freeing compared to creating detailed and realistic drawings of characters or objects.

And a few √¢‚Ç¨≈ìmust nots√¢‚Ç¨:

What your interactive artwork is. How interaction enhances the viewer√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s experience. The artist statement is your chance to explain how interaction enhances the viewer√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s experience in your submission√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùdon√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t assume that we can guess.

You won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t receive a separate mark for the artist statement. It is considered as part of your whole submission. The artist statement is used to help evaluate your ability to design and construct an interactive artwork in line with the assignment specification.

Getting started Here√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s the process for working on the assignment: fork &amp; clone the assignment repo add whatever code you like to make a cool/interesting submission when you run the sketch, hitting spacebar will save a still image of the sketch (as a thumbnail.png file in your Downloads folder)

when you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re happy with your thumbnail.png, copy it into your assignment folder (this will overwrite the previous version) and commit the new version to the repo (and push it up to the GitLab server)

One thing to note is that there are some √¢‚Ç¨≈ìchecks√¢‚Ç¨ which the GitLab server runs to help you out. So if you get a pipeline failed email, then have a look at the FAQ.

Submission checklist my project satisfies the requirements

my completed assignment has been pushed to the GitLab server, and all the required files (your versions of artist-statement.md, references.md, thumbnail.png and sketch.js) have made it to the server

my references.md file includes at least two external references, as well as references for external files that I have created, and everything not mentioned in there is my own work i have viewed and tested my submission on the test URL and it displays / works correctly
